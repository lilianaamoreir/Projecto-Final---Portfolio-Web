I think I could write a book about myself but maybe i should start with a:

" Hi, I'm Liliana!" - a Junior Front-End Developer and Digital Designer with a heart divided between digital world and the creative arts.

I’m 24 years old and have lived in Sintra, Lisbon, my whole life. I’m also a proud mom to a little girl who inspires me to chase what I love and be/do better every day.

Since I was little, I’ve been drawn to everything that tells a story — whether it is a song that stirs emotions, or a letter that captures a fleeting moment. I’ve been singing since I was 4, and along the way, I discovered that writing is my way of expressing raw, intense emotions.

I have a background in Languages and Humanities and a technical degree as a Pharmacy Assistant. I’m passionate about learning new things, especially languages, and in recent years I’ve fallen in love with web development and design. I´m currently working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Canva, and I'm always eager to expand my skills.

Music, writing, and visual arts are my way of expressing myself - raw and unfiltered and I carry them with me into everything I do. I’m an ambivert, a fashion lover, sometimes a little socially awkward, but always empathetic, proactive, and communicative. Slightly addicted to Netflix marathons, naps, and nerdy brain games like solitaire and sudoku.

For me, creativity isn’t just a hobby — it’s a way of seeing the world. Through my projects, I aim not only to build beautiful, functional designs but to leave a little piece of myself in every pixel.

This portfolio isn’t just a showcase of work — it’s a glimpse into the things that move me, the skills I’m sharpening, and the stories I’m still learning to tell.

Let me end with some advice: "It's never too late to chase your dreams and go after what you believe in and the things that make you happy - I myself, might go back to school and become a lawyer by the age of 50, who knows?"

Embrace the journey and sit tight — this is my world.
