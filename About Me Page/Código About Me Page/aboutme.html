          <p >I think I could write a book about myself but maybe i should start with a:</p> <br>

           <p><em>" Hi, I'm Liliana!"</em> — a Junior Front-End Developer and Digital Designer with a heart divided between digital world and the creative arts.</p>
            
          <p>I'm 24 years old and have lived in Sintra, Lisbon, my whole life. I'm also a proud mom to a little girl who inspires me to chase what I love and be/do better every day. </p>
            
          <p>Since I was little, I've been drawn to everything that tells a story — whether it is a song that stirs emotions, or a letter that captures a fleeting moment. I've been singing since I was 4, and along the way, I discovered that writing is my way of expressing raw, intense emotions.</p>
            
          <p>I have a background in Languages and Humanities and a technical degree as a Pharmacy Assistant. I'm passionate about learning new things, especially languages, and in recent years I've fallen in love with web development and design. I'm currently working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Canva, and I'm always eager to learn more.</p>

          <p>My experience also extends to customer service, communication, organization, and volunteering. Interacting with clients to understand their needs, developing my emotional intelligence, making use of the right tools, and coordinating and being coordinated have helped me enhance my problem-solving skills, deliver more effective solutions and be a good team-worker.</p>
            
          <p>Music, writing, and visual arts are my way of expressing myself - raw and unfiltered and I carry them with me into everything I do. I'm an ambivert, a fashion lover, sometimes a little socially awkward, but always empathetic, proactive, and communicative.</p>
            
          <p>For me, creativity isn't just a hobby — it's a way of seeing the world. Through my projects, I aim not only to build beautiful, functional designs but to leave a little piece of myself in every pixel.</p>
            
          <p>This portfolio isn't just a showcase of work — it's a glimpse into the things that move me, the skills I'm sharpening, and the stories I'm still learning to tell.</p>
            
          <p>Let me end with some advice: <span class="myadvice">"It's never too late to chase your dreams and go after what you believe in and the things that make you happy - I myself, might go back to school and become a lawyer by the age of 50, who knows?"</span></p>
            
          <p class="key"><em><strong>Embrace the journey and sit tight — this is my world.</strong></em></p>
